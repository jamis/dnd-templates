This library includes a system for parsing and processing text templates in C.
It was developed primarily to act as the text processing front-end for CGI
applications written in C.

Use of this library is not encouraged, and it is made available only so that
older systems that depend on this library (such as the NPC generator, also
available from this site) may be built.

BUILDING
--------

This library was written well before I knew anything about autoconf and
friends. Thus, the makefile should be considered to be only a guideline, and
you're expected to actually MUCK WITH IT. Yes, I know. How deliciously
primitive.
